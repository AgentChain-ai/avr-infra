## üß™ Complete Testing Workflow

### Step-by-Step API Testing
1. **Start Server**: `uvicorn akash-outreach.app.main:app --port 8000`
2. **Get Token**: Login to get JWT token
3. **Test Each Endpoint**: Use the curl commands above
4. **Verify Data**: Check that data is created/updated correctly
5. **Test Error Cases**: Try invalid data to test validation

### Automated Testing Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# save as test_api.sh

# 1. Login and get token
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST "{{backend_url}}/auth/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "username=admin&password=admin123" | jq -r '.access_token')

echo "Got token: ${TOKEN:0:20}..."

# 2. Test students API
echo "Testing Students API..."
curl -s -X GET "{{backend_url}}/students" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | jq '.total'

# 3. Test analytics API  
echo "Testing Analytics API..."
curl -s -X GET "{{backend_url}}/analytics/dashboard" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | jq '.total_students'

echo "‚úÖ API testing complete!"
```

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Authentication Errors
```
{"detail": "Not authenticated"}
```
**Solution**: Make sure to include the Bearer token in all protected endpoints

### Issue 2: Database Not Found
```
{"detail": "Database connection failed"}
```
**Solution**: Run `python init_database.py` first to create the database

### Issue 3: Permission Errors
```
PermissionError: Permission denied (os error 13)
```
**Solution**: Run server from akash-outreach directory: `cd akash-outreach && uvicorn app.main:app --port 8000`

### Issue 4: Import Errors
```
ImportError: cannot import name ...
```
**Solution**: Make sure you're in the virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`

## ‚úÖ Expected Test Results

After running all tests, you should have:
- ‚úÖ JWT authentication working
- ‚úÖ Students created, updated, and searchable
- ‚úÖ Field configurations managing schema
- ‚úÖ Call logs tracking conversations
- ‚úÖ Context information for AI agent
- ‚úÖ Analytics showing real metrics
- ‚úÖ CSV import processing files correctly

## üéØ Next Steps

Once Phase 1 testing is complete:
1. **Phase 2**: Build Streamlit admin dashboard
2. **Phase 3**: Integrate with AVR voice system
3. **Phase 4**: Add advanced AI features
4. **Phase 5**: Production deployment
